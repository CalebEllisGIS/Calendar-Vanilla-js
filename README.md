# Calendar App

This project is a vanilla JavaScript calendar application showcasing core functionality without external libraries or plugins. It displays the current month, highlights the current day, and categorizes days as past, present, or future. Users can also navigate to view future and past months.

Additionally, the calendar is styled and animated using vanilla CSS.
